## About Me



I am Yura and I am finishing my master's degree in physics at KU Leuven.
Most of my days I am thinking about some specific research-related topics or mastering typical methods of basic parts of physics.
Currently, I am in search of a Ph.D. position or job, for this, I have created this webpage. 
If I can be useful in some research, or if you just want to discuss some parts of physics, write to me, do not hesitate.
