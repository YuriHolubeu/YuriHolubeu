## About Me



Currently, I'm a student of Masters of Physics at KU Leuven.
Most of my days I am thinking about some research-related topics or mastering typical methods of physics or mathematics.
Currently, I am in search of a Ph.D. position or a job, for this, I have created this webpage. 
If have found this page randomly and you want to discuss some of physics or tell me something, write me through the links at the left.
